The positive way to look at the weekend game in which we drew 1-1 with a poor Villa side would be to say we are unbeaten in 7, having won 6. However it really does feel dissappointing and very much 2 points dropped.

Taste of our own medicine after victories against Southampton and Liverpool? We controlled the game from the first minute, conceded a sloppy freekick from which Benteke scored from. De Gea had no chance, Evans should have done better. 

Falcao equalized deservedly in the 2nd half, but we failed to score again and had to settle for a draw.

### Patient build up, zero penetration

For the whole 90 minutes Villa played very deep, little or no pressure was put on our defence and the majority of our passes were from wing back to wing back, constantly transitioning play our, slowly...

This is clearly how the players have been told to play. Irrelevant of formation, we've lacked real pace in our midfield missing Di Maria and perhaps this is how LVG envision's us scoring. Similarities could be drawn with the 2 draws earlier in the season against Burnley and Sunderland away. 

Lack of personnel hasn't helped. We were missing Herrera (illness), Felliani (illness), Blind (knee). Carrick played the first half at CB and we pushed Rooney back into CM. A position he's familiar with, but not a veteran in breaking teams down from deep.

What irk's about the performance seems to be the constant use of the wing's and not even trying to play through the middle. Yes Villa sat deep and had 15 billion men parked infront and behind of Falcao and RVP, but we have 4 top class talent's playing through the middle and hardly touching the ball (RVP, Falcao, Mata, Rooney). 

#### LVG

>"We kept the ball well in the first half but we did nothing with the ball. You have to be creative and effective with the ball - we didn't do that."

### Formation

So is it the personnel or the formation the cause in our lack of penetration? We've certainly not seen ourselves play fast, fluid football playing 352 so far this season. However we've also not had our strongest XI play together yet. Crazy considering we're almost half way through the season. Will we ever see it? 

Playing 442 with the diamond of Blind, Herrera/Felliani, Di Maria and Mata we seem to play with a wide range of build up play. From Di Maria's pace and the Spanish Amigo's passing qualities we can score from anywhere on the field. Results weren't perfect however playing 442.

LVG seem's to alternate formation based on personnel he has available and whom we are playing against. Without Rafael and Shaw, we've been left without full backs, hence a 352 with Young and Valencia. This has generally worked well. With the sheer volume of injuries we pick up, it's understandable to change formation to utilise the players we have best.

LVG's philosophy has been overplayed and spoken about by both the media and himself, but a brand of football shouldn't depend of what formation is played. The more games and training session's their are, hopefully the players will become more accustomed to either and performance's will improve.

### Falcao (the good)

I was great to see Falcao start the game, play 90 minutes and to top it off, get on the scoresheet. His general link up play was very impressive, completing 92% of his passes in the game. The best thing about his game is his movement though. Every single attack he's timing his runs in behind the defender's. He must be a nightmare to mark and will get a hat full of chance's if he stays fit.

### Fletcher (the bad)

This must surely be the last we see of Fletcher? He partnered Rooney in the midfield but was hauled off at half time with Carrick moving up from center back. He looked off the pace but more importantly his passing and choice of pass was woeful. 

Alot of sentiment can be held with Fletcher. He's been a great servant for Man Utd but I think his time is up playing in the first team. 

### Looking ahead

Wanting to finish this post with a positive end, it was great to see Di Maria & Falcao back on the field. Odd substitution's taking RVP off later on in the game so we couldn't see him on as well but having all our attackers fit for the busy Christmas period is essential. Here's to seeing them all play together finally...
