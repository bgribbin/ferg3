No one was marking the Dog or Duck as United ran out 3-0 winner's vs a very much pub team defensive mentality in Liverpool FC. It's a game and day whereby people say form 'goes out the window' and it's all about the result.

Whilst that was the case for Liverpool whom always seem to up their performance vs us, United's form seemed to carry over into this match. Only the real pessimistic United fans care about that tho right now. 

Everything about this fixture last season was sickening. Moyes' press comment's about the reigning champion's being underdogs, 3 penalties against us, zero pace, ambition & heart, a totally gutless performance and thumped 3-0 to the scouser's in our own backyard. 

Fast forward 9 months...No more Suarez, no more Moyes, same old horrendous Brendan Rodgers, and enter Louis Van Gaal with six new signing's. Today's result was made all the sweeter by the fact none of our six signing's started the game. We are missing Di Maria's pace, Shaw's quality and Blind's composure as a DCM. The fact we managed a 3-0 role reversal with the same squad to last year is testament to the wonder's LVG has brought this club and the players. 

Being honest, the performance was again very poor. It's clear to see, LVG's philosophy is to play out from the back at almost all costs. This has caused us multiple problem's the last two games against Pool and Saint's with both team's pressing extremely high up the pitch. Poor misplaced passes were present in both games, alot through Evan's & Felliani in both game's. Injury's have certainly played a part in this. It will be great to have a settled back four at some point and to finally see Blind and Carrick start a game together. Their passing and composure will help eradicate various error's at the back and help start more attacks.

Felliani had another poor game. A slow start, misplaced passes and an early booking however he recovered in the second half to provide some steel. Whilst he made 9 tackles, more than any other player on the pitch, he's not suited as a defensive midfielder when you play out from the back as much as we are. Surely Hererra could play that position when there's no Carrick (playing CB) or Blind (injured)?. He's proven in his short time with us he can get stuck in, incept the ball and his distribution is much better than Felliani's. Felliani provide's an alternative element to any team and has dramatically improved this year however we need to keep looking forward's and up toward's Chelsea and City in the table.

However, we can't have it all overnight. That's six wins from six currently (WWWWWW). 18 points taken in our last 6 compared to 13 points taken in the opening 10. LVG has found his feet at OT. He's more and more dismissive in the press room which I love. The press are petrified of him. He's getting the best out of Valencia & Young as wing backs (whom were both v v good today) and most of the squad. He's got Rooney, Mata & RVP percolating infront of goal and the future is very much bright....
