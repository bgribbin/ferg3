Well once again we managed a smash and grab victory away from home against a top team. Man Utd were outplayed for most of the game but had the quality when it mattered, RVP with two clinical finishes in either half to seal the points.

Here are the player ratings as assessed by Fergie's Hairdryer:

### David De Gea

Couldn't do much about Pelle's goal in the first half, made a number of crucial save's in either half from Long and Pelle. Must be tough playing behind an inconsistent back four/five - 7

### Antonio Valencia

Tough to be critical when played out of position so often and can rarely get forward. Not great, not awful - 6 

### Ashley Young

Same as Valencia. To be fair, he's improved on last season and hard to ask too much when played at left back/wing back instead of a winger - 6

### Rojo

Gave the ball away far too often and invited pressure on him and the defensive. A number of defensive header's in the last 20minutes saved him from getting a 5 - 6

### Evans (Smalling injured early on)

Thrown in due to Smalling's groin injury and was no way near ready, coming back from injury. Similar to Rojo, Evan's dwelled on the ball too much inviting pressure and making mistakes. Not fit and low on confidence, needs a run of games in the reserve's injury free - 5

### McNair

Wounder of a game. Gave the ball away multiple times, head went down, subbed first half - 4

### Felliani

Extremely slopping in possession. Put himself about during the game but gave the ball away for the Saints goal. His poorest performance of the season. - 6

### Mata

Useless having Mata play as a no10 away from home against better opposition. Was a shadow of a player and far too weak on the ball - 5

### Rooney

Added quality on the ball up front with RVP but not involved enough. Worked tirelessly in the 2nd half when under the kosh. Great delivery for RVP's 2nd goal - 6.5

### RVP

Man of the Match. Do we finally have our Robin back? Worked for the full 90 minutes. Held the ball up incredibly well. Gained confidence from an early goal all credit to himself for chasing a miss placed pass. Sheer class finish for the 2nd goal - 8.5

Other Subs

### Herrera

Sloppy in possession as with most the team, put himself about more and improved us after McNair went of, still not great - 6
