It wasn't pretty, but we ground out another victory to make it four wins in four in the league.

To be fair, if we think about it, we knew how Stoke would set up and play so it shouldn't be a big shock how the game went.
Sparky's stubborn Stoke side broke up our flow and frustrated the tempo which we saw against Hull City three days earlier.

### Constantly improving?

My previous post spoke about how we're constantly improving. This game was a case of improving on results and should be left at that. Fact is, Liverpool and Arsenal (our closest rivals for top 4) have both ground out results not played particularly well. I'm glad we can also do the same and move on.

Without Rooney & Di Maria for this one, we took the lead through Felliani. Herrera, in for the injured Di Maria floated the ball in for Felliani to provide yet another assist for our midfield. It's extremely pleasing to see our midfield contribute to more goals and assists this season, what we've been lacking for years. Whilst Herrera & Mata didn't excel as much as against Hull, the momentum is building and their connection is lovely to watch.

The midfield of Hererra, Mata, Carrick & Felliani has a good mixture of technique, power and passing ability. This is fine for our home games against the like's of Hull/Stoke, but we have missed Di Maria. The next 2 league games are away to Southampton then home to Liverpool. We're going to need more. This boils down to pace and width for me. Mixing the play up and getting the ball over the top against defender's. Hopefully Di Maria will be back and LVG can continue to provide the exciting James Wilson with minutes.

Their equaliser came before half time, Felliani got dispossessed and went down. We'd have been lucky to get a freekick from it and Bojan's mazy run into the box resulted in the ball bobbling out to N'Zonzi who finished extremely well giving De Gea not much chance.

### Defensive Partnership?

Although we conceded, I do feel we are improving defensively. Smalling and Rojo started at center back and this could be a nice little partnership, if injuries can be prevented. The way I see it, Smalling is a very good defender. He's tough to get by, quick and strong. Technically, he's a poor footballer. Rojo appear's the opposite. Not the best at defending and abit rash but he's young and can improve. I've been pleased with his technique and passing ability however and think both can get better and better, producing the decent partnership. I'd be tempted to keep this partnership even when Jone's returns.

The winning goal is debatable about who should claim it. A Mata freekick early in the 2nd half (which we started brighter) was crossed into a dangerous area where the keeper doesn't know where to stick or twist. Rojo appeared marginally offside from the freekick but was in a dangerous area. He may thank his heinous spikey hairdo for his first United goal, getting the slightest of touches, the ball bouncing into the goal.

### Wilson

Wilson could have sealed the result later on, showing us glimpses of his pace, beating 2 Stoke defenders and going to glory shooting marginally wide. A more experienced striker would have played the free Van Persie in, but you could understand the head rush he would have experienced, clear through to seal a victory at the Stretford End at the age of 19. Fairly quiet performance from him, but with the right development and learning from Falcao and RVP in training can only do him good.

### Lucky but ultimately deserved  

I remember 12 months ago constantly hearing Moyes' post match interview's claiming we played really well and were unlucky. Well luck certainly was on our side in injury time. A classic goal mouth scramble with Stoke looking for a late equaliser, the ball fell to ex Utd legend Mame Biram Diouf who's shot was somehow kept out on the line by inform Ashley Young. Lucky, but you would probably say we deserved the 3 points over the 90 minutes.
