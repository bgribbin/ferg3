### Kicking on

Gameweek 15 has seen all games played bar Manchester United away to Southampton which is live tonight. Although we have dropped to 5th in the league (overtaken by West Ham of all people), this weekend saw Thierry Welbeck's Arsenal pounded by Stoke, the (in)vincible's Chelsea lose and Liverpool fail to breakdown Sunderland at home. 

It didn't end there and although City won, their talisman Aguero sustained a slipped disk in his back from carrying the team so much. Being honest though, whilst good from a United point of view, it's not nice to see such a fantastic player injured when in such good form, my thoughts are with you Serge.

Whilst this is all well and good, and I enjoy the media's hyperbolic attention drawn away from United, this is the time we really need to push on. We've had the advantage of no European football this season to focus on the league. Yes an obscene amount of injuries but alot of the squad should be fresh and picking up some consistency.


#### Current away league table:

Our only victory away from home this season was to Arsenal, we're playing a team with an exceptional home record so sar this season. Considering last season we were 1 point off the best away form in the league and finished 7th tell you just how important it is we can get results home & away.

### Falcao

The latest MUFC news doing the round's from the media is apparently Falcao's United future is in doubt. Falcao being frustrated at lack of game time and LVG unwilling to treat Falcao any differently to the rest of the squad. 

#### LVG on Falcao
> "I'm not interested...He has to follow my philosophy. Do you understand that? Yes, I'm here because of that."

> "Yes, it is match fitness, I will clarify it with more facts. He has trained now maybe two days after the Stoke match. We had the match on Tuesday, when he played for 15 minutes"

> "...I have to adapt to the needs of the selection [squad]. He can play only 20 minutes on that level because the rhythm of the game in the Premier League is the highest."

The media appear to be making something of this. For me, Falcao has to be eased back into this. He's coming back from an ACL injury and he appears to certainly push himself as hard as he can to come back. To put into perspective, Walcott & Strootman both suffered similar injuries at the same time to Falcao in January and neither are back currently playing regularly.

Falcao will prove to be hugely important in the upcoming festive period and now is not the time to be rushing him back. Yes he is obviously on alot of money and so people demand more of him, I'm still not convinced United should sign him come the end of the season but now calls for patience. Let's see what this kid Wilson can do in the meantime....
