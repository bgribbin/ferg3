So we are now 13 games through the season and nicely positioned in the top 4. Although the start wasn't pretty, I want to give my positive thought's on where we currently stand.


### We're constantly improving 

Even discounting the first 3 games before the transfer window had closed and we were playing abysmally. We've seen a constant improvement in performance (irrelevant of results). 

Goals conceded to Swansea, Leicester and West Ham you could point fingers as to who was out of position. Whether we were playing 352 or 442 we were often exposed due to player's not knowing their positions. It seems after each game, defender's are looking more comfortable and Van Gaal's 'mental' training is finally getting through.

Equally in the attack, free flowing football and the ability for the midfield to get into scoring/assisting position's has improved. Herrera, Felliani, Di Maria, Blind, Mata have all registered goals AND assists. This was unheard of last season in the Moyesy era.


### Squad players are performing 

The most encouranging take-away from the Hull City and Arsenal game's has been the performance's of the 'fringe' players. Chris Smalling, Felliani and Ashley Young all seem to have responded to Van Gaal. He has someone given them confidence, even when not initially first team regular's. 

With all our injuries and fitness concerns, this will prove very significant come the end of the season. One of the great comfort's of supporting United under Fergie was the knowledge that whatever team he put out, he could get them motivated to win the game. It's what we lacked last year and appear to be regaining.

### Onwards and Upwards
